# Welcome to fortee2

fortee2.com is a website that lets you play [Texas 42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(dominoes)) (a domino game) online with other people or computer oponents (bots) for free!

> fortee2 is best suited for larger screens - we don't recommend trying to play with your phone. Tablets are ok.

## Getting started

All you need to get started is a **Google account**. If you don't have one, [follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441) to create one. You can even [create one using your existing e-mail address](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441#existingemail).

Once you have an account, simply visit [fortee2.com](https://fortee2.com) and click on the button labeled "Sign in with Google".

> If nothing happens, or you see a blank page, make sure to enable pop-ups in your browser and try again.


The main page will appear, showing you the list of players currently online as well as a chat room we call "the lobby". Feel free to introduce yourself by sending a chat message - and ask for help if you need it.

## Membership

When you first join fortee2, you will be a **guest**. This means that you can play games with other folks or bots, and you can chat, but you can't sign up for any tournaments.

Also, your display name will be the same as it is in your Google account. Just ask one of our friendly tournament directors (TDs for short) to make you a **member** and change your display name.

Now, you will be able to sign up for tournaments and enjoy everything fortee2 has to offer.

## Be Nice

At fortee2, we pride ourselves in being an inclusive and welcoming community. As such, please be respectful and don't use foul language. In other words: **be nice**.

If you're not, one of our TDs will ban you for a period of time and you will not be able to return.

## Donate

Although fortee2 is free for everyone, it costs to maintain the infrastructure for it. Consider [making a donation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=HS465FN6SX8XG&no_recurring=0&item_name=fortee2.com+maintenance+costs.+&currency_code=USD) to help cover these costs.
